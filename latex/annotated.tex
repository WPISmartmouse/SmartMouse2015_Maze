\section{Class List}
Here are the classes, structs, unions and interfaces with brief descriptions\-:\begin{DoxyCompactList}
\item\contentsline{section}{{\bf \-\_\-\-M\-A\-Z\-E} \\*Maze is graph of nodes, stored internally as an matrix. don't forget to call free\-\_\-maze(maze) after a maze is done being used }{\pageref{struct__MAZE}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{{\bf \-\_\-\-M\-O\-U\-S\-E} \\*Depresents a mouse don't ever change the row/col of a mouse directly. This prevents it from working on the real robot use forward and turn\-\_\-to\-\_\-face to move the mouse around. Once those functions work on the real robot it will port over fluidly }{\pageref{struct__MOUSE}}{}
\item\contentsline{section}{{\bf \-\_\-\-N\-O\-D\-E} \\*Holds its location \& neighbors, as well as a bool for indicating if it has been discovered you don't need to free nodes in a maze, just use free\-\_\-maze however, be sure to free nodes allocated not in mazes I finally gave in an added row and col attributes the node....be very careful you dont get fuck with those. Don't ever move a node around in maze because you risk getting the actual row/col off from the nodes row/col visited is meant for A\-C\-T\-U\-A\-L\-L\-Y visiting, known is just used for searching/solving }{\pageref{struct__NODE}}{}
